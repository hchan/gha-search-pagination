# A showcase of how to search for workflows in GHA

The (gh-pages.yml)[.github/workflows/gh-pages.yaml] will run on any push to `main` on the .github/workflows directory.
This will update (workflows.json)[https://hchan.github.io/gha-search-pagination/workflows.json], (metadata.json)[https://hchan.github.io/gha-search-pagination/metadata.json] which will then be used
to generate a RemixJS UI to help search for workflows
